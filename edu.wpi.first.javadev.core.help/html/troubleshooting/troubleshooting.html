<p>Common problems and solutions encountered when using the FRC Java Development Plug-ins </p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>&nbspSymptom&nbsp</th>
<th>&nbspSolution&nbsp</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Install Output displays Error <span style="color:red">"Attempting to install tools on currently unsupported platform"</span></td>
<td>FRC Java Development Tools must be installed on Windows, Mac, Linux, or Solaris to function correctly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Install Output displays Error <span style="color:red">"Error running javac.exe compiler"</span></td>
<td>Eclipse is currently pointing to a JRE instead of a JDK.  See <a href="settingupJDK.html">Setting up Eclipse with a JDK</a> for instructions on setting Eclipse 
to use a JDK. (A JDK is not the default on Windows and Linux systems)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robot projects can't find base Java classes (non-WPILibJ classes)</td>
<td>The .sunspot.properties file is missing from the expected location.  The most reliable way to 
fix this is trigger an install, which can be done be clicking "Apply" on the FRC Java Dev preference page</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robot projects can't find WPILibJ classes</td>
<td>WPILibJ is not in the designated place (specifically the classes.jar file)  Make sure that classes.jar
is in the directory designated by the WPILibJ directory in the FRC Java Dev preference page</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robot projects can't find standard classes</td>
<td>The SDK is not in the designated place (specifically the squawk_device.jar file)  Make sure that squawk_device.jar
is in the directory designated by the SDK directory in the FRC Java Dev->SunspotSDK preference page</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deploying to the robot fails</td>
<td>First, check that your connection is setup correctly, the robot is on, and that it is setup to use Java. 
If you previously deployed successfully, the port may not have released.  First, try 
<a href="endingProcesses.html">terminating the process</a>.  If this does not solve the problem, exit Eclipse 
and reset your cRIO.  This problem occurs when something prevents Eclipse from automatically terminating the last deploy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>There are errors displayed with WPILibJ or standard imports and classes</td>
<td>First, try refreshing the project (click on it in the package explorer view and press f5).
If this does not solve the issue, delete the sunspotfrcsdk folder from the plug-in folder called
edu.wpi.first.javadev.sunspotfrcsdk<version> and restart eclipse.  You will see output in the console
indicating the SDK is being extracted and installed.  Once "BUILD SUCCEEDED" is shown in the console, 
repeat the first step of refreshing the project.</td>
