<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>There are two types of projects included with the FRC Java Development Plug-ins.
Robot projects, which are empty frameworks for Java code to run your robot, and Sample
projects, which demonstrate how to use various features of WPILibJ.  Both appear in 
the New Project dialog.</p>
