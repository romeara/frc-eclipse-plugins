<h1>Creating a Project</h1>

<p>To create a robot project, first select "New Project" from the toolbar or context
menu.  Then, select either SimpleRobot or IterativeRobot as your template.  SimpleRobot 
is a bare-bones simplified robot setup which includes autonomous and a constantly called
operator control function.  IterativeRobot has periodic functions for more advanced users.</p>

<p>The project wizard will guide you through the steps of building a standard Java project,
after which the robot specific wizard page will appear:</p>

project will be created in your workspace.</p>
