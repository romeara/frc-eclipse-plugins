/**
 * <p>A simple PID subsystem, it enables PID and leaves always on. The PID
 * control loop runs asynchronously in the background, so that once you set a
 * setpoint. It's only is setSetpoint which changes the setpoint the PID is
 * trying to get to. Our PID Input is a potentiometer hooked up to the wrist and
 * our PID output is a motor that drives the wrist. For more information on PID
 * see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller If you're having trouble, 
 * just start with the</p>
 * 
 * <p>This subsystem also declares two constants that represent when the wrist
 * at the right height trying to pickup and when th wrist is in stowed position.
 * These can be used as known setpoints. wrist.setSetpoint(Wrist.STOW) would
 * stow the wrist</p>
 * 
 * <p>Recommended next step: {@link DriveTrain}<br/>
 * Related subsystem: {@link Elevator}</p>
