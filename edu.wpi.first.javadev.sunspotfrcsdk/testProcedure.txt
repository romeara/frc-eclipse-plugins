edu.wpi.first.javadev.sunspotfrcsdk Test Procedure


	- Check that there are two preference pages available, the main page and the SDK
		preference page.
		
	- Re-install of SDK should be triggered:
		- When the plug-in is updated (new install location)
		- When the team number is updated
		- When a different Eclipse install or NetBeans was run since the current Eclipse
			install was last run (install location in preferences does not match location
			indicated by properties file)
			
	- If there were existing FRC Projects and the library was removed (causing errors),
		then the library should re-install.  Following the install:
			- Package View and Editor should refresh and stop showing errors caused by
				missing library
			- Any builder views open should refresh
			
	- Following a re-install, any projects which were using a library from an older version
		of the plug-ins should be updated to use the newer version
