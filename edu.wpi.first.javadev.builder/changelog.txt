The builder plug-ins are intended to provide advanced tools to assist several levels of
code developers write Java programs for the FRC platform


1.0.7.8
--------
	- Bug Fixes
		- Fixed wrong method being called during reconcile causing infinite loop under 
			certain (rare) conditions
		
1.0.7.6
--------
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1303:  Model creation was sped up by multi-threading.  View
			creation for the robot model was also multi-threaded, but runnable locks prevent
			the same from being done in the library view model
1.0.6.6
--------
	- Improvements
		- Changed to utilize workspace output plug-in
		
1.0.6.5
--------
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1222:  Capability wizard now checks if entered return type
			and parameter types exist in the project (if they are not primitives) 
		
1.0.6.4
--------
	- Bug Fixes
		- Fixed issue where containers and robot did not override canModify as they should
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1284: Error and warning dialogs appear when they would be
			expected to 
			
1.0.6.3
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1308: Views now no longer show invalid context menu options.
			Elements are now checked for modify permissions
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1252: Filters being selected now unselects all other filters
			and applies to the view correctly

1.0.6.2
---------
	- Stability/Optimization
		- Changed to correctly use SDK extract/install, and fix view if model failed to
			properly construct project and setup was fixed
	
1.0.6.1
---------
	- Stability/Optimization
		- Placeholders now work correctly.  Circular referencing of Devices will not crash 
			the views
	
1.0.6.0
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1225: Refactor renaming makes view update correctly.  
			Elements can be renamed through the views or by standard methods, and the
			model will refresh itself correctly

1.0.5.9
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1249: Dragging Devices from device palette into editor now 
			adds the correct import
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1296: Devices which come from class files now only display 
			public members
	- Stability/Optimization
		- FRCProject now updates and creates elements if they didn't previously exist 
			correctly
		
v1.0.5.6
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- Double Clicking device now brings user to the the field declaration correctly	
	
1.0.5.5
---------
	- Bug Fixes	
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1285: Disable and Enable now accounts for view elements with no 
			associated element correctly when computing enabled state
	
1.0.5.4
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTFoge Artifact 1214, 1288: Opening, closing, adding, and deleting projects now 
			trigger switching of active project correctly	
	
1.0.4.4
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1217: Can now remove elements using the RoboCentric view from
			both the tool bar and context menu
	
1.0.4.3
---------
	- Improvements
		- Icons disable/enable more logically
		- Fields have visibility options when added 
	
	- Bug Fixes
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1283: Container view elements are valid context menu targets
		- FIRSTForge Artifact 1216: Devices and capabilities can be added to modifiable 
			devices (ones derived from compilation units)	
	
1.0.4.1
---------
	- Stability/Optimization
		- When devices from the palette are dragged into the editor, instead of displaying 
			null, a new field is added.
	
1.0.4.0
---------
	- Stability/Optimization
		- Tree now displays user created devices which are created manually (without being
			immeadiately added to the robot) and multiple instances of the same class in the
			tree reflect changes made with the editor closed using the views
	
1.0.3.8
---------
	- Stability/Optimization
		- Tree now does not display interfaces, and shows user created devices	
	
1.0.3.6
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- Tree now allows adding to sub mechanisms	
	
1.0.3.5
---------
	- Improvements
		- Tree expands to level of added elements	

1.0.3.0
---------
	- Stability/Optimization/Improvements
		- New model being used, addition and drag in of devices/mechanisms works
			correctly, live parsing of robot tree works correctly

1.0.1.9
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- Code fragments now use correct names when dragged into the code editor
	
1.0.1.7
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- Changed creation of display objects for methods to use parent's name in 
			code fragment instead of random place holder	
					
1.0.1.6
---------
	- Improvements
		- Changed display names for devices/mechanisms to be more descriptive
	
1.0.1.3
---------
	- Bug Fixes
		- Changed initial project loader to correctly handle null case	
			
1.0.1.2
---------  
	- Improvements
		- Ability to add devices and mechanisms with default names
		- Ability to add custom functions (capabilities)
		- Live parsing robot tree
		- Ability to drag and drop code into the editor window from the tree view
		- Able to double click on items in tree to open in editor
