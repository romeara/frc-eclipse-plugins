edu.wpi.first.javadev.builder Test Procedure


	- Should be able to use views.  They should construct correctly both when 
		opened after eclipse is started or when they were open when eclipse started
    
  	- The views should display a robot project when opened if an open robot 
		project is available
  
  	- If no open robot project is available, the views should display a no 
		robot message
  
  	- If the active project is closed, the views should switch to an open robot 
		project, or no robot message if no project is available
  
  	- When a robot project is open, the views should switch to display it
  
    - If the active project is deleted, the views should switch to another open 
		robot project, or display no robot messages if none is available
  
  	- When a project is created, the views should switch to display it
  
  	- Clicking with the selected click scheme should navigate to the clicked 
		element(defining field in the case of devices).  The click scheme is set in 
		eclipse preferences, and can be either single or double click
  
  	- Should be able to add elements via the toolbar and context menus
  
  	- Context menus should only allow certain operations.  WPILibJ devices in the 
  		tree should not allow the addition of elements or class renaming.  Robots 
  		should not be removable.
  
  	- Categories under devices and mechanisms should allow context menu adding 
		of the element they are storing
  
  	- Dragging devices into the RoboCentric view from the Device Palette should 
  		add the device where dropped
  
  	- Dragging elements from either tree should add expected code to the editor 
		where dropped
  
  	- Views should respond to changes in the editor
  
  	- Creating a device should cause the device to appear in the Palette view 
		under the "devices" heading
  
  	- Any circular referenced devices should not show children, aka if device A 
		has a field of type Device B, and Device B has a field of type Device A, 
		then Device B's child of type Device A should not show its children - it 
		should only show that it exists in device b
